# 🚀 AI Website Generator - Flask Fullstack Upgrade

## Summary

Your AI Website Generator has been successfully upgraded from generating simple HTML websites to creating complete **professional Flask fullstack web applications**!

- Limited functionality

### After (New System) ✨
- **Complete Flask web applications** with proper MVC structure
- **User authentication** system (login/register/sessions)
- **Database integration** with SQLAlchemy ORM
- **REST API endpoints** for modern web apps
- **Professional UI** with Bootstrap 5 + custom styling
- **Multiple application types** (e-commerce, blogs, task managers, etc.)
- **Production-ready** with proper configuration and documentation

## 📦 What Users Get Now
